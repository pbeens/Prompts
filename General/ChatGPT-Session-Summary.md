## Prompt

Summarize this session in extreme detail using Markdown formatting. The summary is for my personal use and must be designed to help me restart or continue this session in a new thread without missing any context. Follow these exact requirements:

1. Chronological Summary

- Present a detailed timeline of the major points discussed.
- Each point should contain enough context to stand alone, even without access to the original conversation.

2. Decisions, Strategies, and Recommendations

- Document all key decisions made, strategies considered or chosen, and recommendations given.
- Include reasoning, trade-offs, and any relevant justifications or constraints.

3. Unresolved Questions and Next Steps

- Create a clearly flagged section titled ## Unresolved Questions / Next Steps.
- List all open problems, questions, or action items, even minor ones.

4. Code Snippets, Commands, and References

- Include all important code blocks, shell commands, links, or example patterns used.
- Add brief explanations or context for each, even if they were already explained earlier.

5. Continuation Prompt

- If applicable, include a "Pasteable Continuation Prompt" I can use to resume the session in a new thread. This should briefly restate the sessionâ€™s goals and current status.

6. Formatting Guidelines

- Use clear headings and subheadings to separate major sections (e.g., ## Phase 1: Planning, ### Recommendation: Database Choice, etc.).
- Break up content with bullet points, numbered lists, or code blocks where appropriate.
- For long sessions, divide the summary into logical phases and label them clearly.

7. Thoroughness

- Do not simplify, omit, or compress context.
- Capture all relevant nuance, side explorations, caveats, and discarded ideas.
